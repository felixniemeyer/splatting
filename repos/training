install gsplat
- clone repo
- install cuda on os (or verify)
- make venv and activate
- install pytorch
- install gsplat with pip in the rep: `pip install -e .`
- maybe clone the ssim repo and install with `pip install . --no-build-isolation`
- go to examples folder 
- install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

now, the simple_train.py should work
